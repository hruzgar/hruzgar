- Among my proudest projects is [artemis-dl](https://github.com/hruzgar/artemis-dl), an application tailored to streamline the download/archival process for my current universities ([TUM](https://tum.de)) Artemis platform.
- Our outstanding team secured the 4th position in the [Weboost Hackathon](https://github.com/hruzgar/weboost2022).
- I developed a webscraper called [ukeydl](https://github.com/hruzgar/ukey-downloader) to assist students at our university in downloading lecture notes and organizing them effectively.
- I crafted my personal webpage using HTML and CSS. After considerable thought, I concluded a minimalist approach suits my current needs best. Personal webpages don't need to overflow with details; LinkedIn narrates my career path, while GitHub showcases my programming ventures. Also my blog articles can be found at Medium.
- I'm actively honing my coding skills by tackling interview questions and challenges on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
