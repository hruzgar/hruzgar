## 🙌🏻 Intro
Hi my name is Hasan and I am a CS freshman student at Uludag University. Since my childhood I had a keen interest in Computers and how they work. So following that interest I am writing programs to solve problems in an algoritmic way (I think I got too far in my Intro lol).

## 🔭 Projects
- I placed 4th in the [Weboost Hackathon](https://github.com/hruzgar/weboost2022) with my wonderful team.
- I wrote a webscraper named [ukeydl](https://github.com/hruzgar/ukey-downloader), helping all the students at our university, downloading the lecture notes and sorting them accordingly
- I wrote my own [personal webpage](http://ruzgar.eu/) with HTML and CSS. After some big thinking I decided to let my page be minimal and got to work. I am planning to develop a blog page. Maybe with another domain. I want them to be seperate
