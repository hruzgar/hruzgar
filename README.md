## 🙌🏻 Intro
Hi my name is Hasan and I am a CS freshman student at TUM. Since my childhood I had a keen interest in Computers and how they work. 

## 🔭 My Projects and What I Do
- We placed 4th in the [Weboost Hackathon](https://github.com/hruzgar/weboost2022) with my wonderful team.
- I wrote a webscraper named [ukeydl](https://github.com/hruzgar/ukey-downloader), helping all the students at our university, with downloading the lecture notes and sorting them accordingly
- I wrote my own [personal webpage](http://ruzgar.eu/) with HTML and CSS. Some big thinking concluded, that a minimalist page would be ideal for me at the current moment. In my opinion too much information isn't required on a personal webpage. If you want to know my life, you can look it up on Linkedin. If you wanna know what I did in terms of programming, there is a wonderful platform named Github. A Blog page would be helpful in the future(in progress).
- I am solving interview questions / coding problems at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
